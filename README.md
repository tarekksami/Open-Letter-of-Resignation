Esteemed Colleagues,

I am writing to inform you that after almost 4 years as a Data Scientist in Allstate's D3 Division, I intend to resign as soon as 
possible (pending fulfillment of any outstanding contractual obligations) in pr0test of the company's support for Israel as it commits - 
[as renowned Hol0c@ust scholar Raz Segal describes it in this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWGGjLZNuyg) 
[and accompanying article in Jewish Currents](http://bit.ly/48tS94E) - "a textbook case of genocide" in Gaza.


On Nov. 1, it was announced that Allstate would become a partner, alongside Allianz, in a $265M "strategic investment" in Israeli-founded,
US-headquartered NEXT Insurance, which has its R&D center in Kfar Saba, Israel. While the deal had likely been in the works for
quite some time by that point, the timing of the announcement could not possibly have been more odious, as it came the day after Israel
[openly acknowledged that it had intentionally carpet-b0mbed a refugee camp](https://bit.ly/48mzE2b) using American-supplied munitions, killing 
hundreds of innocent civilians in the process. Their alleged target was one single person, and Israel's public relations defense has primarily centered 
around casting doubt on the precise number of civilians who were murdered in the attack.


VC investments of this size have become somewhat rare, particularly in this time of rising rates and economic belt-tightening. In the tech
world, Allstate's deal with NEXT was a rather significant news piece. In fact, it was the [2nd largest funding round by any Israeli
startup in 2023](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/byeo11ikpp). Perhaps the timing was due to simple ignorance or tone-deafness (after all, is the
intentional mass-murder of a few hundred arab civilians really such a newsworthy occurrence that it warrants delaying publication of this release by
even a single day?) But to me, it felt more sinister. Allstate is a company with extremely sophisticated marketing and
PR resources at its disposal - it has created some of the most iconic and memorable advertising campaigns of all time. I
find it very difficult to believe that the team responsible for this announcement had no awareness of the previous
day's atrocities when they made the decision to proceed with its release.


Perhaps you think it's unfair of me to blame companies in Israeli ["civil society"](https://twitter.com/SDonziger/status/1721635001643475354) 
simply because I disagree with the actions of their government. And perhaps you're right. 
I personally think it's unfair to rip apart the bodies of hundreds of caged, starving human beings with high explosives simply because there 
might have been a criminal in their midst. 
At least we can both agree that collective punishment is, in principle, unfair.


After the Oct 7 Hamas attacks, at the October 25 Connections meeting, Tom (rightly) took time out to address the situation and extend
condolences to anyone who might be affected. By the time of the December 5 Town Hall meeting, when Tom next addressed
the company as a whole, [more than 17,000 Palestinians had been killed](https://reut.rs/3S39Qm7), primarily by aerial b0mbardment 
(again, largely with the use of US-supplied weapons systems) - more than ten times as many people as were k1lled in the Oct. 7 attacks. 
Yet Tom said nothing further about it. I suppose he didn't want to spoil anyone's holiday cheer.


The use of [loaded language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_language) by the press and others around this gen0cid3 has been particularly infuriating. 
Words such as "war" and "conflict" are bandied about liberally, creating the utterly nonsensical illusion that Gaza has any line of
defense against the billion dollar jet b0mbers being used against it. There is no more "conflict" going on in Gaza than among 
livestock in an abattoir- there is only intentional, premeditated mass murd3r of a caged and starving population, which has overwhelmingly 
impacted [children](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)02640-5/fulltext). 


Another particularly ridiculous [thought-terminating-cliche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought-terminating_clich%C3%A9) 
being deployed ad nauseum is the notion that this is all somehow excusable because Gazan c1vilians are being used as "human shields" by H@mas. 
1sr@el has now b0mbed nearly every square inch of Gaza ([including places where the 1DF has explicitly instructed
refugees to evacuate](https://twitter.com/WarMonitors/status/1731986367897317520)). 
Before the most recent phase of this g3n0c1d3 began, Gaza was the single most densely populated place on planet earth,
with around 2.3 million people living in an area less than half the size of Naperville, Illinois (the place where I grew up).


1srael loves to assure the world that it is doing "everything possible" to minimize c1vlian harm. [Yet 6 times as many
children were k1lled](https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1719858059193794599) in Gaza in just the first 3 weeks of
Israe'ls assault as during the entire Russian invasion of Ukraine up until that point. Their soldiers [openly gloat on social media about murd3ring
children](https://twitter.com/yenisafakEN/status/1740340568935325947) with seeming impunity.


I have tremendous respect for everyone I've worked with at Allstate. Without exception, I have found you all
to be a first-class group of professionals. I got my first job at age 16, which was 23 years ago, 
for anyone curious, and this is the longest that I have ever stayed with a single organization since then. 
I particularly enjoy this line of work because, as Data Scientists, we are uniquely empowered to pursue the truth 
in a situation, whether good or bad, through 
methodical analysis of the (inevitably flawed and incomplete) information at our disposal. I believe that most of you are 
highly capable critical thinkers, and hope you can understand the reasoning that I have laid out in this message.  There are 
many of you whom I'd very much like to thank personally - I will refrain from doing so here for obvious reasons, but I hope you know who you are, 
and I apologize for being unable to offer you the proper thanks and farewell that I'd normally extend in happier circumstances.


That being said, anyone who wishes to stay in touch is encouraged to do so, and can reach me using the contact info listed below 
(public key included for the privacy-minded).


If this letter garners enough attention, there will doubtless be various attempts made to discredit me personally,
perhaps by finding people from my past to say bad things about me. Some of them may even be true - I'm far from a perfect
person, and I've done my share of things of which I'm not particularly proud. But I'm quite sure that none of them are as bad
as sl4ughtering around 30,000 (as of the time of this writing) innocent people in cold blood.


I encourage those Allstaters who feel as I do about this to lobby the company to change its stance and rethink 
its nine-figure investments in "unicorn" companies linked to genocidal states, particularly after suffering 
five consecutive quarters of losses. Failing that, I would encourage you to seek employment elsewhere, and to ensure
beforehand that your future employers are not complicit with perpetrators of g3n0cide. 


Unfortunately, this is much easier said than done, as support for this genocide is the official policy of the Federal
Government (which should hardly be surprising to anyone with a [functional understanding of US history](https://bit.ly/4aElivz)), 
with enthusiastic support from "both" political parties. We have had a $200 billion carrier 
strike group parked in the eastern Mediterranean for the past several months to help defend Israel as it commits these atrocities 
(it will supposedly be heading home at some [near-but-unspecified point in the future](https://abcn.ws/3RIDN9J)). 
I can't even imagine what the daily costs are to keep a fleet of that size deployed. 


As a child, when learning about the history of the Nazi Holocaust, and reading stories from survivors, I used to wonder what I would 
have done if I had lived in a society which was committing a genocide. I imagine many of you have asked yourselves similar questions at 
various points in your lives. 


Wonder no more.

You're finding out now.


Here are some organizations	which I personally endorse- please consider supporting them if you wish to help financially:

- [Jewish Voice For Peace](https://www.jewishvoiceforpeace.org/)
- [Answer Coalition](https://www.answercoalition.org/)
- [Doctors Without Borders](https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/)

I also encourage you to follow these Palestinian journalists on social media - they are risking their lives daily
(as [scores of journalists](https://bit.ly/41JRSs7) have already been murdered) to bring us on-the-ground coverage of the events as they unfold
